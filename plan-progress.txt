- need to build search criteria for user listing
- currently using links does not trigger code in user listing *FIXED* (add '?dummyparam=dummyvalue' to link href to trigger servlet code) 
- dashboard page needs links to all available reports
- dashboard page needs to display events as default
- can we draw info from google calendar to display in events?
- need to fix up code/project so can use debug function with breakpoint properly
